# Amity GE Project 2013: Maze

Amity Regional High School's 2013 submission for the GE Computer Science competition case study.

The goal was to build an AI which would navigate a complex maze consisting of keys, doors, and simulated "darkness" such that the AI could only see a few steps in each direction.

This submission earned 2nd place.
