     * vision is a class of type PlayerVision that contains information about all the directions you can see
     * 
     * 
     * vision.CurrentPoint is a class of type MapBox containing what lies in each direction as:
     *     MoveType (Open, Blocked)
     *     BoxType (Open, Door, Blocked, Key, Exit)
     *     
     * To look in each direction past your current point use the following variables in conjunction with their repsective arrays
     * 
     * vision.North[vision.mNorth]
     * vision.South[vision.mSouth]
     * vision.East[vision.mEast]
     * vision.West[vision.mWest]
     * 
     * where vision.mDirection is how many open spaces are in that direction vision.Direction is the array of MapBox objects in that direction
     *     
     * lastAction is a boolean of the result of your last action i.e. if you tried to move and that direction was a wall, it would be false
     * Action is what you tell your player to do (move in a direction, pickup a key, or use it to open a door) 
     * 
     * We have provided a very basic AI for moving around
     * 
     * To pickup a key, simply move your player onto the space and check if CurrentPoint.hasKey() is true, then return Action.Pickup
     * 
     * To open a door, simply move to a space next to it and return Action.Use and it will automatically open the door next to you
     * Note: There will only ever be one door next to your character at a time
     * 
     * Lastly if you move onto the Exit space, the game will complete and the number of steps you took will be tracked
     * 
     * not a valid move - returns false (counts as a step)
     * 
     * pass in 2d array of boxes to mapbox
